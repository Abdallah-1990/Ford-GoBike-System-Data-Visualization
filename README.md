## Dataset

> There are 183412 trips in the dataset with 16 features (duration_sec , start_time , end_time , start_station_id , start_station_name , start_station_latitude , start_station_longitude , end_station_id , end_station_name , end_station_latitude , end_station_longitude , bike_id , user_type , member_birth_year , member_gender , bike_share_for_all_trip)


## Summary of Findings

> I depended on some features such as user_type , member_gender , member_birth_year and trips in terms of time andage to answer the next questions :

<ul>
<li>When are most trips taken in terms of time ?</li>
<li>How long does the average trip take?</li>
<li>Does the  most trips depend on user_type or time?</li>
</ul>


## Key Insights for Presentation

<ol>
<li>The distribution of duration in seconds is right-skewed such that the lower duration the more trips.</li>
<li>Although there is slightly positive correlation between age and duration but it doesn't mean any thing. As a result i will consider that there is no any positive relationship.</li>
<li>We can notice that the females have more trips the whole week days than males while males have very much more duration.</li>
